            <h2 class="text-blue" id="download-a-theme">1. Download a theme</h2>
            <p><strong class="text-yellow">Use ONLY ONE source for downloading. You DON'T need to use everything, only for one theme file.</strong></p>

            <h2 id="download-a-theme-gh">1.1. Download a theme using GitHub</h2>
            <p>First, you must know that browsing files on GitHub is just like browsing files on explorer, but for hosted files. Then you can follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, make sure you're on the <code class="inline"><a href="https://github.com/tomrdh/discord-addons" target="_blank">Tomrdh/discord-addons</a></code> repository, and not another one (like a fork).</li>
                <img src="screenshots/tutorials/Capture_TomRdh_2021-07-02_155036785.png" class="integration"/>
                <li>Go to the <code class="inline">download-themes-here</code> folder.</li>
                <img src="screenshots/tutorials/Capture_TomRdh_2021-07-02_155419640.png" class="integration"/>
                <ul>
                    <li>If your window/screen width is small, you'll have to click on "View code" before.</li>
                    <img src="screenshots/tutorials/Capture_TomRdh_2021-07-02_155724559.png" class="integration"/>
                </ul>
                <li>Each folder has the name of the theme itself. Click on the one you want.</li>
                <li>You can now follow the "<a href="#apply-a-theme">Apply a theme on [...]</a>" tutorial.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="download-a-theme-da">1.2. Download a theme using this website</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to the <a href="themes.html" target="_blank">themes</a> page. You can also find it from the <a href="main.html" target="_blank">main</a> page, it's the "View themes" button.</li>
                <li>Choose the theme you want. You can hold on an image to resize it.</li>
                <li>Click on the download button below.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>For GitHub download buttons, it redirects you to the right theme folder.</li>
                    <li>For BetterDiscord's website links, it redirects you to the right theme page.</li>
                    <li>You can look at yourself if there are other buttons available, but it's not required.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>You can now follow the "<a href="#apply-a-theme">Apply a theme on [...]</a>" tutorial.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="download-a-theme-gh">1.3. Download a theme using the <a href="https://betterdiscord.app/themes" target="_blank">BetterDiscord's official website</a></h2>
            <p>Downloading a theme from that website is ridiculously easy. Just go to the theme's page, then you can follow the "<a href="#apply-a-theme">Apply a theme on [...]</a>" tutorial.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-pink">Only official themes are listed on that website, so you won't find every Discord Addons themes, but you can find all other official ones, which are also good.</strong></p>

            <h2 class="text-blue" id="apply-a-theme">2. Apply a theme</h2>
            <p>The tutorial for applying a theme is different for each client modification. <strong class="text-red">We won't explain you how to install a client mod, please use official websites for that.</strong></p>
            <p>All tutorials about applying a theme consider that you're already in the right GitHub folder to get the theme you want.</p>

            <h2 id="apply-a-theme-bd">2.1. Apply a theme on BetterDiscord</h2>
            <p>You probably know the most known one, so this won't be long, and it's very simple, because it's just moving a file in a folder.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Once you found the theme you want (meaning that you're in the right folder on GitHub or the right page on BD), download only the file ending with <code class="inline">.theme.css</code> by clicking on it, next "Raw", and then <code class="inline">Ctrl + S</code>.</li>
                <li>On BetterDiscord's themes settings, click on "Open Themes folder". If it doesn't open, try opening <code class="inline">%appdata%\betterdiscord\themes</code> (<code class="inline">\plugins</code> for plugins).</li>
                <li>Move the file that you downloaded there. And obviously, enable it!</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="apply-a-theme-stylus">2.2. Apply a theme on Stylus</h2>
            <p>Note that Stylus is an extension for browser! Not a real client modification! <strong class="text-red">May not work with Discord on Firefox.</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Once you're in the right folder in GitHub, click on the file ending with <code class="inline">.theme.css</code>, then "Raw".</li>
                <li>Select everything and copy. You don't need to save the file, like with BetterDiscord.</li>
                <li>Click on the Stylus extension icon, then "Manage".</li>
                <img src="screenshots/tutorials/Capture_TomRdh_2021-07-02_161438836.png" class="integration"/>
                <li>On the sidebar on the left, click on "Write new style". <red-word>Don't check "As Usercss"!</red-word></li>
                <img src="screenshots/tutorials/Capture_TomRdh_2021-06-25_213101068.png" class="integration"/><br/>
                <li>Give a name for the style. In the code part, paste everything.</li>
                <li>At the bottom, don't forget to apply only URLs on the domain: <code class="inline">discord.com</code>.</li>
                <img src="screenshots/tutorials/Capture_TomRdh_2021-06-25_211630289.png" class="integration"/><br/>
                <li>Save, and it should be applied!</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="apply-a-theme-gm">2.3. Apply a theme on GooseMod</h2>
            <p>Oh Jesus, on GooseMod it's really easy, but too easy to explain... Just grab the theme from the modules store!</p>

            <h2 class="text-blue" id="customize-oggt">3. Change the background, colors and other things with Opera GX Gaming Theme</h2>
            <p>It's very easy! That's just changing some variables. If you're on BetterDiscord or Powercord, you'll have to open the theme file where you saved it. On Stylus, just click on the edit button.</p>
            <p>Once you opened it, you'll see a lot of variables and values. You don't need to change everything to change the whole theme.</p>

            <h2 id="change-background-oggt">3.1. Change the background</h2>
            <p>There's a <code class="inline">--background</code> variable, that should be the first one. By default, its value is <code class="inline">var(--opera-gx-bg-1)</code>. <strong>You can change this value to:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Another preset background.</strong> The default one is <code class="inline">var(--opera-gx-bg-1)</code>, so you'll just have to replace the <code class="inline">1</code> with another number to see the other preset backgrounds. (eg: <code class="inline">var(--opera-gx-bg-15)</code>)</li>
                <li><strong>A custom background.</strong> This time, delete the whole value, and replace it with <code class="inline">url()</code>. In these parentheses, you'll have to put a direct image link, so you'll have to upload it where you want. Once you did it, right click the image and copy image address. And finally, paste this address in these parentheses, then save. (eg for imgur: <code class="inline">url(https://i.imgur.com/ABcd012.png)</code>)</li>
                <li><strong>Just a color.</strong> Why not? You can use any format you want, like using another variable for this one, a gradient, or even <code class="inline">transparent</code> if you want your BetterDiscord transparent (<a href="#make-bd-transparent-oggt">read more about this...</a>). (eg for colors: <code class="inline">rgb(255, 0, 128)</code>) If you're not familiar with using numbers to set a color, you can try <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker" target="_blank">this color picker</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="change-colors-oggt">3.2. Change the colors and transparency</h2>
            <p><yellow-word>Color variables are <strong>RGB only</strong> (Red-Green-Blue - three numbers between 0 and 255), and transparency ones are only between <strong>0 and 1</strong>.</yellow-word></p>
            <p><green-word> You can use other variables to set multiples ones, to avoid some kind of copy-pasting. The format is <code class="inline">var(--varname)</code>, and replace <code class="inline">varname</code> with the name of the variable you want.</green-word></p><br/>
            <p>Between the background ones, you can see a lot of variables, you can change them like you want, following CSS "rules". You don't need to change everything, unless you know what you're doing. Changing only <code class="inline">Color-Settings</code> should be enough. If you need help about each variable, you can read the comment next to the set value.</p>

            <h2 id="use-available-preset-oggt">3.3. Use an available preset (NEW)</h2>
            <p>You have to go in the <a href="https://github.com/Tomrdh/discord-addons/tree/master/download-themes-here/OperaGxGamingTheme/presets">presets</a> subfolder in GitHub at the top of the files (or by following this path: <code class="inline">download-themes-here</code> --> <code class="inline">OperaGxGamingTheme</code> --> <code class="inline">presets</code>), then <a href="#download-a-theme-gh">download</a> the ones you want.</p>

            <h2 id="submit-preset-oggt">3.4. Submit your own preset (NEW)</h2>
            <p>Not here yet, but will be available soon. You can start creating your presets from now on, then wait when submitting will be available and announced. Custom presets will be credited by yourself and the theme's author, and will be manually verified. Small changes could be applied without changing the appearance.</p>

            <h2 class="text-blue" id="remove-lines-between-messages-oggt">4. Remove lines between messages with Opera GX Gaming Theme</h2>
            <p>There are 2 ways to remove these lines between messages. The first one is setting the message spacing to <strong>0 or 4px</strong> from Discord's Appearance settings.</p>
            <ul><img src="screenshots/tutorials/Capture_TomRdh_2021-07-02_175055597.png" class="integration"/></ul><br/>
            <p>The second way, open the theme file, and paste this code at the very bottom:</p>
            <pre>.groupStart-23k01U {<br/>    border-top: none !important;<br/>}</pre>

            <h2 class="text-blue" id="make-bd-transparent-oggt">5. Make BetterDiscord transparent with Opera GX Gaming Theme</h2>
            <p><red-word>This works only with BetterDiscord, and any other client modification that supports a transarency option, which must be <strong>enabled</strong>. Also, Discord must be <strong>fully relaunched</strong> if you just enabled that right now (BetterDiscord should prompt you a confirmation).</red-word></p><br/>
            <p>If you're ready to make this theme transparent, then first open the theme file. At the very top of the variables, you can see the <code class="inline">Background-Settings</code>. Just set both variables to <code class="inline">transparent</code>, and save. <i>If it's required, reload Discord, or the theme itself.</i></p>

            <h2 class="text-blue">Have another question?</h2>
            <p>You can suggest to add something in this tutorial, or ask directly, in the support server. Just use the button below if you aren't already a member.</p>
